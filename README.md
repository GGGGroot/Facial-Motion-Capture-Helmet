## Background   
  Some autism has difficulty holding a conversation or understanding facial expressions when talking with others.     
  Facial dysmorphia is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance.  
  Vtubers need a headset to help them with their creative work.
## Technologies   
  Facial recognition    
  LED strip design     
## Difficulties    
  Finite distance & light            
  Motion Recognition     
## Business prospects         
  Vtuber       
  VR Device          
  Cyberpunk art installation
## Project Planning
#### Main programming - Shenjia Ding and Zihao Wang
- [ ] searching information about how to realise real-time face recognation
- [ ] building the environment of openCV and dlib library
- [ ] writing facial recognition functions of the program
- [ ] constructing training set and performing training
- [ ] conducting Unit test of the facial recognition function
- [ ] writing main function
- [ ] conducting unit test of the main function
- [ ] combining the LED strip function into the main program
- [ ] testing the final program  
#### LED strip designing and soldering - Wenjin Chi  
- [ ] Buying LED strip and camera
- [ ] writing LED testing program to test LED strip
- [ ] booking a laboratory and carrying out soldering work
- [ ] connecting to the Raspberry Pi and testing the performance of the LED strip
- [ ] writing the corrsponding expressions display in LED strip
- [ ] conducting unit test of the expression display function
- [ ] creating social media of this project
- [ ] upgrading social media and README file
#### Hardware designing and document writing - Yixuan Pang
- [ ] creating github repository of this project and writing the README file
- [ ] designing front panel of the helmet
- [ ] booking a technical service to 3D print the front panel
- [ ] upgrading README file and creating Gantt chart of this project to illustrate timeline
- [ ] designing base plate of the helmet
- [ ] booking a technical service to 3D print the base plate
- [ ] writing boot-up coding
