- Wenjin Chi: LED strip designing and soldering, expression display coding
- Zihao Wang: pair programming as navigator and constructing good training set
## Background   
  Some autism has difficulty holding a conversation or understanding facial expressions when talking with others.     
  Facial dysmorphia is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance.  
  Vtubers need a headset to help them with their creative work.
## Technologies   
  Facial recognition    
  LED strip design     
## Difficulties    
  Finite distance & light            
  Motion Recognition     
## Business prospects         
  Vtuber       
  VR Device          
  Cyberpunk art installation
## Project Planning
