## Project Contributors
- Yixuan Pang: project management and hardware designing
- Shenjia Ding: pair programming as driver and system environment set-up
- Wenjin Chi: LED strip designing and soldering, expression display coding
- Zihao Wang: pair programming as navigator and constructing good training set
## Project Description
  The facial-motion-capture helmet is a real-time facial expression feedback system by using the camera to capture the wearerâ€™s facial emotion based on the Linux embedded system - Raspberry Pi, and then the corresponding expressions are fed back into the light array for display. This expression recognition system uses the OpenCV and dlib libraries in C++ for video signal acquisition and real-time feedback of facial expressions and can currently recognise basic emotion like happy, sad and calm. The expressions displayed in real time are cute and can be used as a device for Vtuber and for treating people with autism.
### Background   
  Some autism has difficulty holding a conversation or understanding facial expressions when talking with others.     
  Facial dysmorphia is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance.  
  Vtubers need a headset to help them with their creative work.
### Technologies   
  Facial recognition    
  LED strip design     
### Difficulties    
  Finite distance & light            
  Motion Recognition     
### Business prospects         
  Vtuber       
  VR Device          
  Cyberpunk art installation
